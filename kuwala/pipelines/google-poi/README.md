# Google POIs

Nearly every customer facing business and POI is represented on Google. Apart from data on reviews and categorization 
there is also aggregated and anonymized movement data available represented as a popularity index for a location.

The popularity is a relative score per location between 0 and 100. A score of 100 for a given hour represents the time 
of the respective place with its highest number of visitors during the week. Each value is marked with a timestamp which
makes it suitable for time series analysis.

For places with a very high number of average visitors there is also the live popularity for the current hour available.
This score can also be over 100 if the number of visitors is extraordinarily high.
